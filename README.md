J2EP
====

Fork from the http://j2ep.sourceforge.net/ project. A java reverse proxy can be deployed on a J2EE server. The project is initially developed by Anders (http://sourceforge.net/users/anders\_n) but is not active since 2005.

As I am using this tool at work recently, I am going to put any patches or enhancement to the original project here.
